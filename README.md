# Technical Interview Algorithms

Welcome to this collaborative repository designed to **practice algorithms and prepare for technical interviews**.
The goal is to share exercises, learn different ways to solve them, and explore the **peculiarities of each programming language** used.

# Purpose

This repository aims to:

* Gather both classic and original technical interview problems.

* Encourage individual practice and collaborative learning.

* Compare and understand different problem-solving approaches across programming languages.

# How to Contribute
1. Solve an existing exercise

    1. Create a new branch from ```main```.

    2. Follow the branch naming convention described below.

    3. Write your solution using any programming language you prefer.

       * You may explain your logic through comments in your code or by using GitHub comments.

    5. Do not create a Pull Request (PR) for your solution — solution branches will not be merged into ```main```.

       * This allows the repository to stay clean and avoids enforcing a single “official” answer.
      
2. Propose a new exercise

    1. Create a new branch following the exercise naming convention.

    2. Add a new Markdown file containing the problem statement, and optionally an example input/output.

    3. Open a Pull Request (PR) targeting the main branch.

      * Only branches that propose new exercises will be reviewed and considered for merging.

    4. Once approved, your exercise will be added to the repository

# Naming Conventions
## Branches for solutions

Format:
```bash
solution/<exercise_name>_<language>
```

Examples:
```bash
solution/two_sum_python
solution/merge_sort_java
solution/reverse_linked_list_scala
```

## Branches for new exercises

Format:
```bash
exercise/<exercise_name>
```

Examples:
```bash
exercise/maximum_subarray
exercise/valid_parentheses
```

## Exercise files

Format:
```
exercises/<exercise_name>.md
```

Example:
```
exercises/two_sum.md
```

Each exercise file should follow this structure:
```
## Exercise: Two Sum

Given an array of integers and a target number, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.

**Example:**
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]
```

# Style Guidelines

* Use clear and descriptive variable and function names.

* Include comments that explain key decisions or logic.

* Avoid using unnecessary external dependencies.


# Code of Conduct

* No disrespectful language or behavior will be tolerated.

* All contributions should promote **learning and collaboration**.

* Be kind, constructive, and respectful when reviewing or discussing others’ work.
